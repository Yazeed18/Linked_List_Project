Program Definition for a Linked List that can "replace" the work of an accountant. The Program is able to insert a transaction in a list that can be read, sorted and update some of the header values. The program mainly relies on knowledge of Linked Lists, pointer manipulation, sorting algorithms and object oriented programming.

Most of the Header files that are missing were provided by the course instructors and as such are not listed here.

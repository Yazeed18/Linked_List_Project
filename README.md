# Linked_List_Project

Program along with supporting files can be found in the Folder named "**Linked_List"**.

Program Definition for a Linked List that can "replace" the work of an accountant. The Program is able to insert a transaction in a list that can be read. The list can then be sorted and updated with figures such as Capital Gain/Loss, Number of Shares and Adjusted Cost Base (ACB). The program mainly relies on Linked List and pointer manipulation with object oriented programming. 

**DISCLAIMER:** *This program is accompanied with other defintions, and header files that were supplied by my PROFESSORS which I do not have access to upload instead I can provide my own code for which was used to complete the project.*

# Linked_List_Project

Program Definition for a Linked List that can "replace" the work of an accountant. The Program is able to insert a transaction in a list that can be read. The list can then be sorted and updated with figures such as Capital Gain/Loss, Number of Shares and Adjusted Cost Base (ACB). The program mainly relies on Linked List and pointer manipulation with object oriented programming.
